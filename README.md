# Moving Mass Simulator
Simulation of a system made of two objects: 
one that is allowed to move over a table without friction, one that is connected to the first one through a cable.
Various cases are examined: when the cable cannot extend a when it can, various mode of numeric approximation can be selected.

The simulation is hosted with Github Pages at the url: https://richie314.github.io/moving-mass-simulator/

The simulation uses <a href="https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js">Decimal.js</a> library for numeric integration and 
<a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/">three.js</a> for 3d rendering. 
<a href="https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax">MathJax</a> is used for Latex display
